# Complex VPC

In this example we will create a complex VPC.

What constitutes a complex VPC?

The assumption here is that this a more realistic VPC and therefore consists of:

1 - VPC  
2 - Public Subnets (x3)  
3 - Private Subnets (x3)  
4 - Route Table  
5 - Internet Gateway  
6 - Network Access Control List (NACL)  
7 - NAT Gateway  

Each public/private subnet is in a different availability zone.
